# :star2: Smart Garage System :star2: 
:star2: This project is based on BlackPill microcontroller | STM32F401CCU6 | ARM CORTEX-M4

## :star2: Project Features: :star2: 
:star2: Real-time garage tracking system through wired and wireless communication means.

:star2: Wired through another ECU monitoring device(UART).
    
:star2: Wireless through a server(WI-FI).

:star2: Indication LEDs at garage door.

:star2: IR sensors tracking slots' states.

:star2: Automatic garage door operation with respect to availability inside.

:star2: A complete autonomous man-free process!

:star2: Check garage availability at the comfort of your own seat, no more time wasted!


## :star2: Notes: :star2:
:arrow_forward: Simulation is done using Proteus, check it out!

:arrow_forward: src folder is project's COTS folder following standard layered architecture hierarchy.

:arrow_forward: A fully detailed presentation discussing project idea, key values, our future vision and much more is included too, don't miss it out:smile:
